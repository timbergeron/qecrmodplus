//  It is recommended that timelimit, fraglimit, pausable, noexit and
//  deathmatch be set from crmod.cfg.
//
//  *** NOTE ***
//
//  If you use this autoexec.cfg in the crmod directory with a listen
//  server, your regular autoexec.cfg (in the id1 directory) will NOT be 
//  executed.  You should therefore either 1) not use this autoexec.cfg, 
//  or 2) manually call the appropriate .cfg files to set up your personal 
//  bindings.

// Use samelevel 2 with teamplay 1/2 to start the server in Match mode.
// Use samelevel 2 with teamplay 0 to start the server in Individual mode
// Use samelevel 4 to start the server in Practice mode.
// Don't use anything to start the sever in Normal (FFA) mode.

// sv_aim 2 is *strongly* recommended.  It turns off the autoaiming

// It is strongly recommended that you leave this as is, as higher values 
// will affect the physics and annoy experienced players.  However, if you 
// are running an HPB-only server for amateur players, you might consider 
// changing it to 0.07 which can reduce lag, but make some common rocket
// jumps impossible.  Do *not* make it any higher than 0.07 unless you 
// don't want anyone playing on dm3, as the mound->quad rocket jump becomes
// impossible at this point.
